              Mental health issues have become a significant and growing concern
              for university students.</span
            >
            According to American College Health Association (2019) on health
            assessment for Canadian universities, 51.6% of students reported
            that they had experienced depression within the last year, 68.9% had
            felt overwhelming anxiety, and 87.6% had been mentally exhausted.
            Although many college students are struggling with different mental
            health issues, the assessment has shown that the majority of them
            (67%) never asked for professional support.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/chats.png" alt="charts" />
          <p class="mb-3 text-xl">
            University students can be detrimentally impacted by mental health
            issues on their academic performance and life satisfaction (Arslan
            et al., 2009). The most common mental health problems in students
            include depression, eating disorders, and sleep difficulty, which
            may prevent them from reaching short-term and long-term educational
            goals. Besides, university students suffering from depression are
            more likely to overindulge in drinking and smoking, lose
            concentration, and experience difficulties in emotional control. On
            top of that, suicide can be one of the most serious consequences of
            long-term depression among university students (Yusoff et al.,
            2013).

              <p class="mb-3">
                Many students are not aware of the on-campus counseling services
                (Beebe, 2017). Eisenberg et al. (2007) found that 51% of
                students did not know where to go for mental care, and 41% were
                unaware of free counseling services offered on campus. Moreover,
                many students do not even understand and recognize their mental
                health problems. Students often perceive high-level stress and
                anxiety as normal for university life, so they do not think
                mental health support is necessary (Sasaki, 2014). Even though
                mental supporting services have proven to be an effective use
                (Sharkin, 2004; Hinderaker, 2013), the programs are often
                underutilized by university students (D’Amico et al., 2016).

              <h4 class="font-bold mb-3 text-teal-700">Stigma</h4>
              <p class="mb-3">
                The other notable barrier to access mental health support is
                self-stigma and perceived stigma (Gulliver et al., 2010; Lee &
                Jung, 2018). Self-stigma happens when individuals have negative
                attitudes towards themselves (Sussman et al., 1987); for
                example, they will regard depression as a result of their weak
                personalities. Perceived stigma refers to perceptions of
                negative responses from others (Barney et al., 2006); people
                might suppose the counselor looks down on them while asking for
                help. These two types of stigma explain why university students
                are reluctant to approach face-to-face counseling services for
                help.

                The project is intended to identify the obstacles that limit
                university students from seeking mental services, and thus to
                provide them with a rich amount of information to consult with.
                However, our information service program is not designed to
                intervene in a mental health crisis. Based on the research, our
                team concluded a persona to establish empathy with their
                frustrations and identify their needs.

                There wasn’t enough time to process ethics reviews within the
                course project, therefore, surveys were not conducted to collect
                data from targeted users. Through intensive literature review,
                our team has determined the user group of this project to be
                university students who need mental health support.
